## Hi there 👋

Back in my early uni days, I remember the thrill of creating my first simple app using Eclipse. It wasn't much, but seeing my ideas come to life on screen? That was seriously cool 😎. It sparked something in me, and I just kept learning and pushing myself. All that hard work paid off when I started winning some coding competitions 🏆.

Fast forward through graduation and landing a gig as an Android Engineer at a multinational company 🏢. Life was good! But then, on a whim, I applied for a fast-track S2-S3 scholarship... and got in! 🤯 So, there I was, juggling work as an Android Engineer (this time at a startup - gotta love the startup life and constant learning curve 🚀) with my postgraduate studies.

My S3 research dove deep into the world of AI, specifically data, machine learning, and IoT 🤖. But you know what? All that hands-on experience as a software engineer was a massive help! And eventually, I made it through, graduating with a PhD under my belt 🎓, bringing together my expertise in AI data and machine learning, project management, and good ol' Software Engineering 💪.

So, yeah, that's a bit of my journey. Always been passionate about tech and building cool stuff. Let's connect and build awesome things together! ✨
